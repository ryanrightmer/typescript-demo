# Typescript Demo

This project is a basic CRA application that can be run with `npm run start`

Connecting to the API requires running bhp-web-api locally, due to CORS. Run the master branch of bhp-web-api and add `"http://localhost:3000"` to the list of CorsOrigins in appsettings.json. Run the API prior to starting this React application.
